## Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Evan Owens, and I am a second year Computer Engineering Student at the University of British Columbia. I am passionate about the hardware/software intersection, and hope to become a firmware/embedded software engineer. Here you can find some of my recent projects and work!

## Recent Work
### [EvanRTOS](github.com/EvanO12/EvanRTOS)
EvanRTOS is a custom Real Time Operating System built for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers. It features a pre-emptive, Priority-Based Scheduler, Counting Semaphores, and Message Queues. It also supports task timeouts, and FPU context perservation during context switches.

### [UBC Solar](github.com/UBC-Solar/firmware_v3)
I am an active member of the Embedded Software subteam of UBC Solar, an engineering design team building and racing solar powered cars. Currently, I am working on our Telemetry System, predominately on the firmware side, to ensure robust data collection from our car, Brightside.

### [Bootloader Prototype](github.com/EvanO12/Bootloader-Proto)
A custom bootloader prototype built on the STM32 F411RE microcontroller. It allows for the external flashing of the Microcontroller with new binaries over UART, from a host Application written in Python. This project was designed in order to gain the skills and expertise to integrate a full, proper bootloader at UBC Solar. In the near future, we plan to use this as a basis of a CAN Bus and perhaps even OTA bootloader for all the electronic control units on our car.

### ProCrastination Android App (link coming soon)
ProCrastination is an Android Application with the goal of reducing procrastination amongst students. It does this by providing the users with an mechanism to record their study sessions, and compete against their friends. Students can join custom groups, and see their study performance against their peers on the leaderboard. Studying for longer is better, but if the user tries to leave the app at any time, a strike is added to their study session. This project was made in collaboration with other students in the CPEN 221 Software Construction Class at UBC.

### Other
I've also worked on Autonomous Class Algorithms for an Arduino Powered Robotic Claw, built a  Turing Complete RISC Machine in SystemVerilog, and worked on a Java based Image Processing program, all in my coursework at UBC.
